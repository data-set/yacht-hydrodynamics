# yacht-hydrodynamics
**Goal:**<br>
To create a machine learning model to predict residuary resistance of sailing yachts.

**Abstract**:<br>
Delft data set, used to predict the hydrodynamic performance of sailing yachts from dimensions and velocity.

**Data Set Information:**<br>
Prediction of residuary resistance of sailing yachts at the initial design 
stage is of a great value for evaluating the ship's performance and for 
estimating the required propulsive power. Essential inputs include the basic 
hull dimensions and the boat velocity.

**Attribute Information:**<br>
1. Longitudinal position of the center of buoyancy, adimensional. 
2. Prismatic coefficient, adimensional. 
3. Length-displacement ratio, adimensional. 
4. Beam-draft ratio, adimensional. 
5. Length-beam ratio, adimensional. 
6. Froude number, adimensional. 
7. Residuary resistance per unit weight of displacement, adimensional.
